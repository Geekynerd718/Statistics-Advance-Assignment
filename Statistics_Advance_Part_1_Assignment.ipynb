        "\n",
        "Ans - A **probability distribution** defines the likelihood of different values that a **random variable** can take, while the **expected value** represents the **average outcome** over many trials.\n",

        "### **How They Are Related:**\n",
        "1. **Expected Value as a Weighted Average**  \n",
        "   - The **expected value** (\\(E(X)\\)) is calculated using the probability distribution.\n",
        "   - For a **discrete random variable**, it's given by:\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     E(X) = \\sum x_i P(x_i)\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "   - For a **continuous random variable**, it's an integral over the probability density function (PDF):\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     E(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x f(x) dx\n",

        "   - A **uniform distribution** makes all outcomes equally probable.\n",
        "   - A **normal distribution** centers values around the mean.\n",

        "     \\[\n",
        "     E(X) = (1 \\times \\frac{1}{6}) + (2 \\times \\frac{1}{6}) + ... + (6 \\times \\frac{1}{6}) = 3.5\n",

        "- The expected value helps in **decision-making** (e.g., betting, insurance, investments).\n",
        "- **Risk assessment** in finance, business, and science relies on probability distributions to predict average outcomes.\n"
